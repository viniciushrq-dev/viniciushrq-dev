# 👋 Hi, I'm Vinicius Vieira

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a passionate technology enthusiast focused on learning and building practical solutions. I'm currently diving deep into:

## 🧠 What I'm Studying

- **DevOps & Cloud Engineering**  
  Learning CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**, and deploying applications on **AWS (EC2, Fargate, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFormation)**.

- **Python Development**  
  Building personal projects like a **Task Manager App** using **Python + SQLite**, focusing on clean code, database interaction, and desktop UI with **Tkinter**.

- **Docker & Containers**  
  Studying how to containerize applications for better portability and deployment.

- **Serverless Applications**  
  Creating serverless REST APIs using AWS services and automating everything with YAML templates.

## 🚀 Projects in Progress
